# Finding associations in France
A repository for work conducted during DataInsight Event #1 which aims to find information about associations/charities in France.

## Housekeeping
I suggest that we keep this repo tidy by:
- keep information that may be useful to others in the main folder
- place our own scripts in a folder with our own name/name of work in it

I think there will be lots of jupyter notebooks which can cause conflicts, so please do not push other peoples notebooks that you have opened but not edited!
