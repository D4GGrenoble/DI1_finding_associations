# Notes on potentially useful columns
From Pierre Pereira :)

In order to have a better understanding of the columns,
here is a selection i've made, after a little research
of what each columns mean.

Note: 
The siege is the official association's location (where the mail is sent for exemple).
The gestion is where the association does its job, its events. This location is more interesting
if we want to meet or contact them.

Each columns starting by 'adrs' means siege address, and when starting by 'adrg', it means gestion address.

Useless columns:
    - id_ex: old unique number (now id)
    - siret: falcultative number, identifying an address (we already have the address)
    - rup_mi: useful for the minister
    - gestion: ? nothing found on the internet, seems useless ?
    - groupement: Federation, Union or Simple association, not usefull
    - date_decla: last time the association updated its status
    - date_publi: when the association's creation has been wrote in the JO (journal keeping all associations informations)
    - objet_social1: seems like random numbers, nothing found on the internet
    - objet_social2: same as objet_social1
    - adrs_complement: specifications about siege location (like floor number)
    - adrs_repetition: doesn't seem to mean anything ?
    - adrs_codeinsee: old number, not used anymore
    - adrg_declarant: name of the person that declared the association (not that important, 97% of the column is nan)
    - adrg_complemid: 73% is nan, not useful for the gestion's location
    - adrg_complemgeo: same as adrg_complemid
    - adrg_distrib, adrg_codepostal: useless for the gestion's address
    - dir_civilite: useless
    - publiweb: useless
    - maj_time: useless

Useful columns:
    - id: unique RNA number identifying each associations
    - date_creat: association's date of creation
    - date_disso: if dissolved, the date of dissolvation
    - nature: whether the association is declared or not (D for declared)
    - titre: Name of the association
    - titre_court: initials
    - objet: Goal of the association
    - adrs_numvoie, adrs_typevoie, adrs_libvoie, adrs_libcommune, adrs_codepostal: with all those columns combined, we have the siege location
    - adrs_distrib: seems like when all the columns above are not well filed, this column fill the void (maybe not that useful)
    - adrg_libvoie, adrg_achemine, adrg_codepostal: gestion's address
    - adrg_pays: country where is the association (mostly france... the city seems enought ?)
    - siteweb: mostly nan, but when exists, its cool
    - observation: some comments on the association (like old names, relocations...), mostly nan
    - position: Active, Dissolved, Supressed
